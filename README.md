# SUNYLA_midwinter_2022

While preparing to publish datasets, I ran into a problem: how can I make information in hard-to-understand and specialized metadata structures more accessible for potential users/reusers of the data? And can this solution help solve data deluge problems from multiple sources like ILS systems, repositories, web statistics like Google Analytics, usage statistics, program attendance, etc that can overwhelm users? My answer was to take an old approach to this relatively new problem by using literate programming, a methodology defined by Donald Knuth in 1984 that integrates a programming language and at least one document markup language in the same file, to generate replicable and versionable documentation and reports. This presentation will be useful for anyone who benefits from assessment reports or deals with data/metadata in a library. Attendees will be given access to this Github repository with examples along with resources that they can bring back to their institution to generate their own custom reports as websites, word documents, PDFs, and other formats.
